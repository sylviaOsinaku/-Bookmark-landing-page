## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned
i learned how to use display flex more efficiently,email input validation.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<hr>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  filter:invert(),brightness()
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
  event.preventDefault()
  setTimeOut()
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me with getting the right box shadoww . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox,form validation,other css styles. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
